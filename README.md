# 🛡️ Ransomware Detector 

A defensive cybersecurity project written in Python that demonstrates how to monitor filesystem activity, track events, calculate file entropy, verify file integrity with hashes, and generate alerts.


# Features

- Monitor a directory for file activity
- Log file creation, modification, deletion, and rename events
- Track filesystem activity over time
- Calculate Shannon entropy of files
- Generate SHA-256, SHA-1, SHA-512, and MD5 hashes
- Evaluate metrics using configurable heuristics
- Generate informational, warning, and critical alerts
- JSON sample data for testing
- Unit tests using pytest
- Modular project architecture

# Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer
- pip

---

# Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ransomware-detector.git
```

Enter the project directory:

```bash
cd ransomware-detector
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# Requirements.txt

```text
watchdog>=3.0.0
pytest>=8.0.0
```

---

# Running the Application

Start the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

Example output:

```text
2026-07-04 15:00:00 | INFO | Monitoring: ./watched
Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

---

# Testing

Run all unit tests:

```bash
pytest
```

Or:

```bash
pytest -q
```

---

# Example Workflow

1. Start the application

```bash
python main.py
```

2. Create a file

```bash
echo "Hello World" > watched/test.txt
```

3. Modify the file

```bash
echo "More text" >> watched/test.txt
```

4. Delete the file

```bash
rm watched/test.txt
```

The application logs each event.

---

# Configuration

Configuration values are stored in:

```
config.py
```

Examples:

```python
MONITOR_DIRECTORY = "./watched"

WINDOW_SECONDS = 60

MAX_EVENTS_PER_MINUTE = 250

LOG_LEVEL = "INFO"
```
